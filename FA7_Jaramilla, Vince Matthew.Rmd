Exercise 15.1
1. A machine produces memory sticks of varying lengths, distributed uniformly between 2 and 12 mm. Memory sticks longer than 10 mm do not meet the design criterion, and must be scrapped.

(a) Calculate the probability that a memory stick will be scrapped.
(b) Simulate 50 memory stick lengths and obtain a histogram of the simulated values. Calculate the simulated mean and variance.
```{r 1}
#a
scrap_prob <- (12-10)/(12-2)
scrap_prob

#b
stick_lengths <- runif(50,2,12)
curve(dunif(x,2,12), xlim = c(0,12))
curve(punif(x,2,12), xlim = c(0,12))

hist(stick_lengths, breaks = 10, main = "Simulated Memory Stick Lengths", xlab = "Length by Millimeter", ylab = "Frequency")

mean_lengths <- mean(stick_lengths)
mean_lengths
var_lengths <- var(stick_lengths)
var_lengths

#printing
cat("\n1\na) Probability that a memory stick will be scrapped:", scrap_prob)
cat("\nb) Mean of 50 simulated lengths:", mean_lengths)
cat("\n   Variance of 50 simulated lengths:", var_lengths)
```

2. Students in an electronic engineering laboratory measure current in using an ammeter. Due to several random factors, the measurement X follows the pdf

f(x) = 0.025x + b, 2 < x < 6

(a) Show that, for this to be a genuine probability density, b = 0.15.
(b) Find the probability that the measurement of the current exceeds 3.
(c) Find E(X).

```{r 2}
#a
ammeter_function <- function(x)(0.025*x +0.15)

bvalue_0.15 <- integrate(ammeter_function,2,6)
bvalue_0.15

#b
current_over_3A <- integrate(ammeter_function,3,6)
current_over_3A

#c
x_ammeter_function <- function(x)(x*(0.025*x +0.15))

e_of_X <- integrate(x_ammeter_function,2,6)
e_of_X

#printing
cat("\n2.\na) The integral of 0.025x + 0.15 from 2 to 6 is 1, showing a genuine probability density.")
cat("\nb) Probability that the measurement of the current exceeds 3: 0.7875 with absolute error < 8.7e-15")
cat("\nc) E(X) = 4.133333 with absolute error < 4.6e-14")
```

3. In a radio communications system, the phase difference X between the transmitter and receiver is modeled as having a uniform density in [-pi,pi]. Find P(X<=0) and P(<=pi/2).

```{r 3}
prob_0 <- punif(0, -pi, pi) - punif(-pi, -pi, pi)
prob_0
prob_piover2 <- punif(pi/2, -pi, pi) - punif(-pi, -pi, pi)
prob_piover2

#printing
cat("\n3. P(X<=0) =", prob_0)
cat("\n   P(<=pi/2) =", prob_piover2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
